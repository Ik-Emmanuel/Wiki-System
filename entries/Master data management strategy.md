# Master data management strategy
Master data, as the name implies, deals with the key business entities such as product, customer, service,  employee, and supplier. Master data management (MDM) strategy helps in delineating the source systems  of master data creation and systems that would update/delete and consume master data.
 The MDM strategy  deals with defining an MDM architecture that could be operational/analytical or hybrid depending on the business objectives the strategy would need to address.
