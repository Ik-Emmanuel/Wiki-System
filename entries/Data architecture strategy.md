# Data architecture strategy

Data architecture strategy is one of the key pillars of EIM landscape. Data architecture defines the way  data entities are modelled for system of record, data marts, and operational data stores.

 Data architecture  includes the policies and rules concerning how data are sourced, stored, integrated, arranged, and used  in decision support systems such as data warehouses, data marts, and operational data stores. Data  architecture blueprints also ensure that information management programs align with the key business  objectives.
